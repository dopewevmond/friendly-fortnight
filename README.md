## React todo app with CRUD functionality

### Getting started
- Run `npm i` to install all dependencies.
- This project uses Prettier and ESlint for formatting. You can download and enable the VSCode extension for both. 
- Alternatively, you can add an entry in the `package.json` file like so `"format": "prettier --write \"**/*.{js,jsx}\""` and `"lint": "eslint \"**/*.{js,jsx}\" --quiet"` for Prettier and ESLint respectively.
- Run `npm run dev` to start the server on [localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234).
